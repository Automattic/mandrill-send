# mandrill

Dead-simple mandrill API implementation. Only sends emails.

## How to use

```js
var email = require('mandrill-send')('your-api-key');
email({
  from: 'Guillermo Rauch <rauchg@gmail.com>',
  to: ['a@b.com', 'c@d.com']
}, function(err){
  if (err) console.error(err);
});
```

## API

The module exports a function that takes the API key and returns the
sender function.

The sender function accepts an object of options and optionally a callback.

The options passed to the sender function are the same as the ones
described in the
[Mandrill API](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/messages.html)

In addition, two enhancements are present:

- All emails can be expressed as `Name <email@host.com>`, and they'll
  be parsed automatically and the right fields will be sent to Mnadrill.

- `from` can be set intead of `from_email` and `from_name`:

  ```js
  email({ from: 'Guillermo Rauch <rauchg@gmail.com> });
  ```

- `to` can be expressed as an array of emails:

  ```js
  email({ to: ['a@b.com', 'c@d.com'] });
  ```
